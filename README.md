## DIY Smart Contract: **Deadman's switch**

- A well-known problem for cryptocurrency holders is that all funds are lost if the owner is incapacitated and has not shared his/her private key with anyone else.
- A smart contract that will send all of its balance to a pre-set address if the owner of that contract has not called a still_alive function on the contract in the last 10 blocks.

Design, write and deploy a deadmanâ€™s switch to goerli
